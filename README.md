# rar-mfs
rar-mfs is an algorithm for feature selection and can be employed to select features from labled data sets. 

```
--> TODO: short example of usage
```

The Relevance and Redundancy Framework (RaR), which is the theory behind the implementation, is a novel feature selection algorithm that 
- works on large data sets,
- can handle differently typed features (e.g. nominal features and continoues features), and
- handles multivariate correlations.
